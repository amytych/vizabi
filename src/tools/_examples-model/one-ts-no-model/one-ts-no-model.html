<!-- Example Timeslider A -->

<div class="vzb-tool-one-ts-no-model">
	<h2>One Timeslider, no model</h2>
	<p>This example tool shows a time slider without a time model. Internally, when the component does not receive its expected model, it falls back to an empty one, with default values, completely detached from the state and  external page events:</p>
